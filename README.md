Task description:
The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships.
Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

1x Battleship (5 squares)
2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to target.
Shots result in hits, misses or sinks.
The game ends when all ships are sunk.

You can write a console application or UI to complete the task.

Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task;
we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features.
Most importantly, keep it simple.

Please include a link to the source and instructions on how to build and run it.
